This the website for the workshop "Larger Than Memory Data Workflows
with Apache Arrow and Ibis" taught at the J on The Beach conference on
May 10th, 2023.


## Abstract

As datasets become larger and more complex, the boundaries between
data engineering and data science are becoming blurred. Data analysis
pipelines with larger-than-memory data are becoming commonplace,
creating a gap that needs to be bridged: between engineering tools
designed to work with very large datasets on the one hand, and data
science tools that provide the analysis capabilities used in data
workflows on the other. One way to build this bridge is with Apache
Arrow, a multi-language toolbox for working with larger-than-memory
tabular data. Arrow is designed to improve performance and efficiency,
and places emphasis on standardization and interoperability among
workflow components, programming languages, and systems. We'll combine
the power of Arrow for compressing data into its most compact form
with Ibis for data analysis in Python. Ibis is a pandas-like, Python
interface that allows you to do robust analytics work on data of any
size. It does this by letting you choose from a range of powerful
database engines that can process your data queries. In this workshop
we'll be working with a very large dataset and drawing insights from
it all from our local machine.
